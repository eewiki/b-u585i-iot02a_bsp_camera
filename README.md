# Simplified B-U585I-IOT02A BSP files for MB1379 camera module

These files are stripped-down versions of the B-U585I-IOT02A BSP files found in the [STM32CubeU5 MCU Package](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubeu5.html). While the original files handled the configuration and initialization of the perhiperals required for interfacing with the camera module (i.e. DCMI, I2C, GPIO), these simplified BSP files utilize the user code generated by the STM32CubeMX tool. This allows the user to graphically change the peripheral configurations and avoid/resolve conflicts when scaling the project to utilize other peripherals. As supplied, these files provide a layer of abstraction for the ov5640 camera driver. The OV5640 image sensor is used by the MB1379 STMicroelectronics camera module (available with an adapter board in the [B-CAMS-OMV bundle](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/stmicroelectronics/B-CAMS-OMV/13677506).
